# embedded-cv
The goal of this project is to create an embedded system capable of classifying MNIST numbers using a 
binary neural network. Images are gathered using the OV7670 camera and stored in a RAM buffer. This 
data can then be processed. First goal is to stream frames from the camera to a VGA monitor.
